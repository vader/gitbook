# Journal Entries

The [Chart of Accounts](chart-of-accounts.md) is the collection of all your ledger accounts and and within these ledger accounts we add Journal Entries.&#x20;

Journal entries can be manually added or automatically created. They can be a simple transaction or very complex including multiple splits and matches in various currencies.&#x20;

What is common is that every transaction has an opposing transaction.&#x20;

For example if $100 left your Bank Account for travel expenses and you categorized it as Travel & Transportation you will have two transactions even although you only entered one:\
`Bank Account -> Out (Credit)` \
`Travel & Transportation -> $100`&#x20;

Business owners:

Most of your accounting transactions are done from two places:\
<mark style="color:green;">Chart of Accounts > Assets > Cash & Cash Equivalents</mark> \ <mark style="color:green;">Chart of Accounts > Liabilities > Credit cards</mark>\
\
Think of money flowing into and out of your account account. If you are going to reconcile a a transaction with an expense you start at the Bank ledger account and match the Expense.&#x20;

Fiskl does not allow you do do it the other way.&#x20;
