# Company settings

*   ✅ **Step 1 –** From the left menu, click on the gear icon and select “Company settings” here you can save your company details which Fiskl will use throughout the app.

    ✅ **Step 2 –** Enter your general company details.

    * Company industry was entered as part of registration but can be changed.
    * Once your base currency is set during registration, it cannot be changed directly as it is connected to your company’s transactions and exchange rates. Click [here](https://fiskl.com/help/changing-base-currency/) to find out how to change it.
    * Your email address is the one which will be used for all transactions in Fiskl.
    * Add your company ID or registration number, if you would like it to be displayed on your invoices and quotes go to [Templates and Brands](https://fiskl.com/help/templates-brands/).
    * By adding the timezone for your company, Fiskl will automatically use the selected timezone for company documents such as recurring invoices, Fiskl uses your company time zone to determine what part of the day your company is in (so that your client receives their invoices correctly at say 8am in your company’s selected time zone).
