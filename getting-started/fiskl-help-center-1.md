# Fiskl Help Center

As an accountant, you can create an account for your client using your custom Fiskl URL, so that Fiskl bills you instead of the client (e.g for example you sell packaged services where Fiskl is included in the package).

✅ **Step 1 –** Create the client’s account using the custom Fiskl URL link tailored to the desired plan, using your client’s email address for account setup, eg https://my.fiskl.com/registration?code=specialcode\_solo, https://my.fiskl.com/registration?code=specialcode\_pro or https://my.fiskl.com/registration?code=specialcode\_prime.

> Before you invite your clients, ensure that you receive your custom link from Fiskl with the associated discount as per your agreement with Fiskl and ensure that you specify the maximum number of clients you would like to configure for each plan for the next 12 months at a minimum. Clients numbers can be increased on request (up to 24h turnaround, except for week-ends).

✅ **Step 2 –** Your client will need to verify their email to be able to access their Fiskl account.

✅ **Step 3 –** Once verified and logged in, your client needs to go to “Team Members” from the left menu and click on “Invite new member”.

You will receive an email notifying you of your accountant access. Log in or register on the Accountant Portal and accept the notification displayed on your portal home screen.

> If you've been using a trial account, delete that account before accepting the invitation as Fiskl allows a single email per login. Then, register for a new account using the same email address.

> You can find “Delete account” instructions [here](https://fiskl.com/help/plans-billing/account-management/delete-your-fiskl-account/).

✅ **Step 5 –** Click [here](https://my.fiskl.com/portal/registration) to register on the Accountant Portal.

**How does the billing process work?**

1. Billing Process: Fiskl will issue a monthly invoice to your accounting firm for all active clients and users, applying any agreed-upon discounts (as per agreement).
2. Deactivation Protocol: If a client discontinues service, the accountant must notify Fiskl to manually deactivate the account.
3. Visibility of Billing Information: Clients will not have access to the Subscriptions and billing page nor will they see any pricing details within the account.
4. Bank and Payment Integrations: Clients have the ability to connect their bank accounts and payment gateways to Fiskl (within account tier limits for bank connections).
5. Account Billing Modifications: Clients are restricted from changing their service plan (upgrading/downgrading). However, they can add additional users within the limit of their current account plan. Requests for more users can be accommodated upon request from the accountant.

**Notes:**

* An accountant can be invited to multiple companies with the same email as an accountant.
* A client cannot set up multiple companies with the same email address.
* If an accountant has used a Fiskl trial account as a Client, then they will need to delete the account so they can use the email as an accountant. [https://fiskl.com/help/delete-your-fiskl-account/](https://fiskl.com/help/delete-your-fiskl-account/)
