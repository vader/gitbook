For instance, you may want your invoice numbers to begin at “INV-0250”. Fiskl will then number the following invoices sequentially based on your starting number, so the next invoice would be INV-0251, then INV-0252, and so on.&#x20;

    If you changed the name for your invoices this will also be used for future invoices.
