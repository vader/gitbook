You can import your bank statements into money accounts for reconciliation and accounting.

Money accounts are:

* All accounts from Cash & Cash Equivalents COA.
* All accounts from Credit Cards COA.

> This is only for accounts which are not automatically connected as manually importing transactions over automatically imported transactions can result in duplicates and thus incorrect accounting records.

✅ **Step 1 –** Visit your online banking website and download an electronic statement for your bank or credit card account in any of these file types: .qif .ofx .csv.

✅ **Step 2 –** From the left menu, click on Accounting, select Transactions and click on the account that you would like to import your bank statement to.
